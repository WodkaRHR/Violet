## Showing that a revolution is needed
- We probably want to slowly introduce it:
    - the player should kind of be "indoctrinated" by Faun that everything is fine
    - do we want to show it under the surface even in early cities? (Blütenbach??)
    - how to make Faun also ambigous, while not being outright evil?
- Black Market:
    - Run by Devin, Faun let's this be
    - Sell stolen Pokémon


### Swamp in the jungle
- Former Pokéball factory destroyed huge parts of the jungle (home to the tribe there)
- Turned it into a huge swamp
- Tribe had to work in the factory (?)
- At some point, potentially after some rebellion (?), the factory was layed still and the land returned to the tribe
- No compensation for the destroyed jungle
- Some of the tribe therefore joined revolution
- However not the Gym Leader: He sees through the problem of this revolution


## Showing that the revolution is flawed
- Albus ambivalent:
    - Does care about the well-being of others
    - But also wants to be on the top, very ambitious
    - Unclear to which extent the revolution is selfish of him
- Revolutionaries buy Pokémon from the Black Market, that is run by Devin:
    - They are criminals: Some of them are outcasts that take refugee, similar to Team Violet
    - They recruit whoever opposes the Elite Four: Blackbeard is part of the problem
