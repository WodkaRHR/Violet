# Chrones
- Bosses:
    - Adam (PLAYER's dad)
    - Eve (Leader of the Chrones)
    - Maybe they had used the time stone? Who knows, we can make up their motivations on the fly?

- First generation (creations of Adam and Eve): 
    - Rubys: Incarnation of the Magmaherz
    - Saphira: Incarnation of Ozeanseele
    - Emerys: Incarnation of Atmossenz
- Second generation:
    - Based on Tarot cards (these are the "goons" of the Chrones)



# Past
- Chrones are humans who controlled the legendary pokemon
    - Magmaherz, Ozeanseele, Stratosalve (?)
- See themselves as guardians of the world:
    - Scarcely used their terraforming capabilities
    - Did not abuse the time stone (?)
- Dark Queen stole the time stone
    - Uprising against the Chrones using the time stone
        - Controlled Celebi and manipulated time
    - Won Magmaherz (from Rubys (?)), and got controll over Groudon
    - Won over Saphira, and tried to take control over Kyogre
        - PLAYER's dad stopped her, defeated her
        - In the process, using Kyogres weather powers, Atlantea was sunk
            - A huge cyclone engulfes the sunken island and that's why nobody has found it
    - PLAYER's dad decides to spend some time on the "mainland"

    - It was decided that the time stone is to be split to prevent humans from controlling time again
        - The controlling items were used to command the legendary trio to guard the time stone fragments
    
# Later past
- PLAYER's dad wants do end the reign of the Chrones: What is the motivation? Maybe his children?
    - PLAYER's dad tried to steal the controlling items
        - Gets the Magmaherz and Ozeansoul
        - Fights over Stratosph√§re, but loses and has to escape
            - Magmaherz and Ozensoul get lost in the process

# In story
- Rubys seizes the chance to get the Magmaherz back from Mistral, after Groudon was awakened
    - Why did he not take the partial time stone?
        - Does he not want it?
        - Maybe Mistral opposed Rubys, and got away somehow...


# Afterstory
- Maybe Eve finds out that Mistral and PLAYER are Adam's children?
    - She gets jealous and wants to eliminate them?
        - Rather lackluster...
        Something freedom yata yata?
