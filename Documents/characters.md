# Revolutionaries (maybe call them Rebels?)

- The revolutionaires want to overthrow the E4 system and establish a democracy. 
- Albus refers to himself as the "last champion", as he wants to install the democracy successively

## -- Commander in Chief of the revolution --
- Rival of Larissa
- joined the revolution to defeat her
- not so much concerned with the E4 system, but also acknowledges the need for change
- female or male? should be the opposite of larissa, so maybe goth-like?

## Lucky
- Opportunistic
- First stole in the Pokéball factory to Blackbeard
- then joined his crew
- former first mate of Blackbeard, but stole Nuggets from him
- was imprisoned
- was freed from prison island by the revolutionaries in the past
- somewhat of a coward
- goofy

## Igva (call her differently? Irene?)
- Convinced, that Albus will lead the E4 to a better system: Why
    - Does she need a "backstory" (prob something shallow) as a motivation?
    - something with the volcano?
- Beliefs in people's participation
- Kind-hearted
- In love with Mistral
    - They joined the revolution together, even though Mistral just wanted to meet Albus and learn from him
- Sees the same "thing" in PLAYER as in Mistral and commits to making them join

## Albus
- Former E4 member, one of the founders
- Somewhat jealous of Lucius' position as Champion
    - believes he is more suitable and wants the title
- We need some event that triggered him founding the revolution
    - probably something to do with Larissa taking the throne
- Best friend: Faun
    - Wants Faun to join the cause, but Faun sees through Albus' ambitions
- Goal: Install a government by people, but he should be the proxy champ to design that government

## Blaise (partially)
- see Blaise


# Team Violet

- founded by Primus
- first recruit: probably Rin
- "official" goal: seize control over Theto using a "terrible weapon"
    - reality: Primus opens space time portal to guide the Deoxys race towards earth
    - Primus is controlled by Deoxys

## Primus, Leader
- Secret leader of the organisation: Only the commandants are aware of his identity
- was first controlled by Deoxys when investigating the meteor impact of Bruchfels
- ever since under Deoxys' control
- personaility (not Deoxys):
    - insecure
    - kind
    - weak-minded, gives up easily
- ambivalent:
    - is only so much persuaded by Deoxys as it promises him fame as a scientist using space travel


## Lucius, 1st Commander
- Former champ, was defeated by Larissa
- after losing a rematch, was recruited by Primus
    - he promised Lucius to overthrow the E4 and reinstall him as the Champ
    - Lucius does not buy Primus' promise and suspects that Primus secretly wants to take over
        - Therefore, Lucius plans on taking the weapon that Primus claims to build for himself
- arrogant
- focus on power and strength
- highly ambitious
- also somewhat fond of the advocate system, as it rewards power and goes with "power is law"
Life Quest:
- Hunt down Rayquaza, that injured him in his younger days almost deadly
- Whole Team is "Dragon-Slayer" like

## Mistral, 2nd Commander
- Joined because Primus promised him the weapon and access to legendary Pokémon
- Idol: The Dark Queen who ruled through legendary Pokémon
    - wants to utilize legendary Pokémon to become powerful
- Half-brother to PLAYER
- self-centered, ambitious
- interested in history, great figures of the past
- trained Icarus, when exploring the cloud islands and learning about the ancient histroy

## Rin, 3rd Commander
- Sister to Narcissa
    - always stood in her shadow, Narcissa buillied her
    - wants revenge and prove herself over Narcissa
- Joined Team Violet to defeat Narcissa and "win" by having a higher position than her
- Cruel, spiteful, does not care for people

# Elite Four

## Narcissa

## Faun

## Danica
- was Lucius' prodige, trained by him
- how much of his brute-force nature did she inhert?
