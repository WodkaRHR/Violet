# Revolutionaries (maybe call them Rebels?)

- The revolutionaires want to overthrow the E4 system and establish a democracy. 
- Albus refers to himself as the "last champion", as he wants to install the democracy successively

## -- Commander in Chief of the revolution --
- Rival of Larissa
- joined the revolution to defeat her
- not so much concerned with the E4 system, but also acknowledges the need for change
- female or male? should be the opposite of larissa, so maybe goth-like?

## Lucky
- Opportunistic
- former first mate of Blackbeard, but stole Nuggets from him
- was freed from prison island by the revolutionaries in the past
- somewhat of a coward
- goofy

## Igva (call her differently? Irene?)
- Convinced, that Albus will lead the E4 to a better system: Why
    - Does she need a "backstory" (prob something shallow) as a motivation?
- Beliefs in people's participation
- Kind-hearted
- In love with Mistral
    - They joined the revolution together, even though Mistral just wanted to meet Albus and learn from him
- Sees the same "thing" in PLAYER as in Mistral and commits to making them join

## Albus
- Former E4 member, one of the founders
- Somewhat jealous of Lucius' position as Champion
    - believes he is more suitable and wants the title

    - probably something to do with Larissa taking the throne
- Best friend: Faun
    - Wants Faun to join the cause, but Faun sees through Albus' ambitions
- Goal: Install a government by people, but he should be the proxy champ to design that government

## Primus, Leader
- Secret leader of the organisation: Only the commandants are aware of his identity

- Former champ, was defeated by Larissa
- after losing a rematch, was recruited by Primus
    - he promised Lucius to overthrow the E4 and reinstall him as the Champ
