## How to play

As this game is a romhack and providing roms is illegal only a patch will be provided. Thus you need to own a __German Firered rom__ file (be aware that even downloading those roms is illegal however). An in-depth tutorial for patching will be provided here(TODO: insert link)


## Supported languages

The game currently only is availible in __German__. However there is work in progress for translating the game into the __English language__. If you would like to help translating, refer to (TODO: insert link)
